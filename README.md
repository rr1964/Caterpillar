# Caterpillar
A sample of code (both Python and R) that I wrote while working for Caterpillar. These are provided soley for their ability to demonstrate work I have done in R and Python.

I also have shared an example file of SQL that I used in Big Query on Google Analytics. 

Most of the data associated with these Python and R scripts are proprietary, so they are not shared here.
